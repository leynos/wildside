# Developers guide

This guide is the canonical reference for day-to-day contributor workflows in
this repository. It explains how tests are structured, how behavioural tests
with `rstest-bdd` are written, and which quality gates must pass before
commit.

Use this guide with the [Wildside testing
guide](docs/wildside-testing-guide.md). The testing guide is an operations
quick reference, while this document defines strategy and usage conventions.

## Testing strategy

The test suite combines unit, integration, and behavioural tests:

- Unit tests cover pure domain logic and edge-case handling in small scopes.
- Integration tests verify adapter behaviour against real infrastructure, such
  as embedded PostgreSQL.
- Behavioural tests describe user-visible flows in Gherkin features and bind
  them to Rust step definitions.

All suites run through the same quality gateways:

- `make check-fmt`
- `make lint`
- `make test`

## Rust behavioural tests with `rstest-bdd` v0.5.0

### Dependency contract

Behavioural suites pin `rstest-bdd` and macros to `0.5.0` in dev-dependencies.
The macros use strict compile-time validation:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
rstest-bdd = "0.5.0"
rstest-bdd-macros = { version = "0.5.0", features = ["strict-compile-time-validation"] }
```

This enforces step and scenario consistency during compilation and prevents
feature files drifting away from local step definitions.

### Scenario binding conventions

Keep scenario fixture parameter names aligned with step fixture names. In this
repository, many suites use `world` as the shared fixture key.

Use explicit no-op bindings in scenario functions:

```rust
#[scenario(path = "tests/features/example.feature")]
fn example_scenario(world: ExampleWorld) {
    drop(world);
}
```

`drop(world);` is intentional. It preserves fixture-key compatibility for step
injection while keeping warning gates green under `RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings"`.

### State isolation model

Scenario state is isolated by default:

- Prefer per-scenario fixtures and `ScenarioState` data structures.
- Use `Slot<T>` for optional or late-bound values within one scenario.
- Use `#[once]` only for expensive, effectively read-only infrastructure.
- Do not rely on scenario execution order or cross-scenario mutable state.

### Async step guidance

`rstest-bdd` v0.5.0 supports async step definitions. In this repository:

- Prefer synchronous step functions when the harness already owns a runtime and
  deterministic execution is more important than style changes.
- Use async steps when they materially reduce adapters/wrappers and do not
  create nested runtime issues.
- If a synchronous scenario must run async-only work, rely on library fallback
  semantics rather than creating nested Tokio runtimes manually.

### Where behavioural tests live

- Backend scenarios and steps:
  - Feature files: `backend/tests/features/`
  - Scenario bindings: `backend/tests/*_bdd.rs`
  - Shared BDD helpers: `backend/tests/support/`
- Example-data scenarios and steps:
  - Feature files: `crates/example-data/tests/features/`
  - Scenario bindings: `crates/example-data/tests/*_bdd.rs`

## Adding or changing behavioural tests

When adding a new behaviour:

1. Add or update the Gherkin scenario under the correct `tests/features/`
   directory.
2. Add or update Rust step definitions with `#[given]`, `#[when]`, and
   `#[then]`.
3. Add or update the scenario binding function with `#[scenario(...)]`.
4. Keep fixture naming consistent across scenario binding and step functions.
5. Run all three gates before commit:
   `make check-fmt`, `make lint`, and `make test`.

When migrating existing suites, prefer incremental edits that preserve scenario
intent and avoid broad rewrites that obscure regressions.
