# Wildside backend roadmap

This roadmap captures the outstanding delivery work for the Wildside backend.
It follows the phase → step → task hierarchy defined in
`docs/documentation-style-guide.md`. Progress is tracked with checkboxes; tasks
may only be marked complete when their acceptance criteria are met and the
related automated checks pass.

The backend must uphold the hexagonal modular monolith described in
`docs/wildside-backend-architecture.md` from the outset of every change. Hex
architecture is not a future refactor: every deliverable must lean on the
domain, port, and adapter seams established in Phase 0. No downstream task can
be considered done if it violates these constraints.

## Phase 0 – Hexagonal foundations

These steps gate all other phases. Complete them before tackling feature
delivery, so future work remains inside the hexagonal boundaries.

### Step: Domain and ports baseline

- [ ] Create `backend/src/domain/mod.rs` by moving the existing
  `backend/src/models` module (errors, users, future route entities) and
  enforcing constructor validation plus immutable state.
- [ ] Introduce explicit port traits inside `backend/src/domain/ports.rs`
  (e.g. `RouteRepository`, `RouteCache`, `RouteQueue`, `RouteMetrics`,
  `UserRepository`) with strongly typed error enums instead of `anyhow::Result`.
- [ ] Replace direct DTO usage in `backend/src/api/*` with domain factories
  (e.g. `RouteRequest::try_from_login_payload`) so inbound adapters never
  construct domain structs manually.
- [ ] Convert shared error handling in `backend/src/models/error.rs` into
  domain error types that translate to HTTP responses via adapter-level
  mapping.

### Step: Adapter boundaries

- [ ] Move the current `backend/src/api` module into `backend/src/inbound/http`,
  keeping handlers thin (request parsing → domain service call → response
  mapping) and removing any persistence or session logic from the handler
  bodies.
- [ ] Rework the WebSocket entry point in `backend/src/ws` into an inbound
  adapter (`backend/src/inbound/ws`) that consumes domain events instead of
  building messages inline.
- [ ] Introduce `backend/src/outbound/persistence`,
  `backend/src/outbound/cache`, and `backend/src/outbound/queue` modules to
  encapsulate Diesel, Redis, and Apalis integrations once those backends are
  introduced, wiring them to the new port traits.
- [ ] Update all modules to depend on the domain ports rather than reaching
  into `backend/src/models` or framework-specific types, ensuring the
  dependency flow points inward.

### Step: Architecture guardrails

- [ ] Extend `docs/wildside-backend-architecture.md` with inbound/outbound
  module diagrams, port usage examples, and a checklist for introducing new
  adapters, so the boundaries stay visible.
- [ ] Add an architectural lint (e.g. dependency allowlists enforced via
  `cargo deny` or a custom build script) that fails when inbound adapters
  import outbound modules or infrastructure crates directly, and wire it into
  `make lint`.
- [ ] Provide integration tests that exercise HTTP and WebSocket handlers
  against mocked ports to ensure adapters remain side effect free and domain
  logic stays framework-agnostic.

## Phase 1 – Core access and sessions

All delivery in this phase must consume domain services via the inbound HTTP
adapter; direct stateful logic belongs behind the ports established above.

### Step: Session lifecycle hardening

- [x] Implement `POST /api/v1/login` with signed-cookie sessions, two-hour TTL,
  and production-grade key management.
- [ ] Wire `/api/v1/users/me` and `/api/v1/users/me/interests` to require the
  session middleware, returning `401` with trace identifiers when
  unauthenticated.
- [ ] Enforce configuration toggles for `SESSION_SAMESITE`,
  `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`, and `SESSION_ALLOW_EPHEMERAL`, failing fast in
  release builds when secrets are missing or keys are too short.
- [ ] Document and script the rotation procedure for session signing keys,
  including Kubernetes secret rollout and dual validation during deploys.

### Step: Route submission idempotency

- [ ] Persist `Idempotency-Key` headers for `POST /api/v1/routes` in
  PostgreSQL, rejecting conflicting payloads with `409` and replaying
  successful responses within 24 hours.
- [ ] Capture idempotency audit metrics (hits, misses, conflicts) and expose
  them via Prometheus with labels for user scope and key age buckets.

## Phase 2 – Data platform foundation

Ensure schema and ingestion work expose their operations through domain ports
so persistence details stay confined to outbound adapters.

### Step: Schema baseline

- [ ] Deliver Diesel migrations that materialize the schema in
  `docs/wildside-backend-architecture.md`, including GiST/GIN indices and
  unique constraints for composite keys.
- [ ] Generate ER-diagram snapshots from migrations and store them alongside
  documentation for traceability.

### Step: Data ingestion and enrichment

- [ ] Ship the Rust-based `ingest-osm` CLI with documentation covering
  filters, provenance logging, and deterministic reruns over launch geofences.
- [ ] Add Overpass enrichment workers with semaphore-governed quotas, circuit
  breaking, and metrics wired to the enrichment job counters.
- [ ] Configure enrichment provenance persistence (source URL, timestamp,
  bbox) and expose it via admin reporting endpoints.

## Phase 3 – Pagination infrastructure

Pagination relies on domain repositories exposing ordered queries via ports;
see `docs/keyset-pagination-design.md` for the detailed crate design.

### Step: Pagination crate foundation

- [ ] Implement `backend/crates/pagination` providing opaque cursor encoding,
  `PageParams`, and `Paginated<T>` envelopes with navigation links, backed by
  unit tests for cursor round-tripping.
- [ ] Add support for direction-aware cursors (`Next`/`Prev`) with serde-based
  encoding and property tests ensuring decode-encode stability.
- [ ] Publish crate-level documentation outlining ordering requirements,
  default/maximum limits (20/100), and error mapping guidelines.

### Step: Endpoint adoption

- [ ] Replace offset pagination in `GET /api/users` with the new crate,
  including Diesel filters that respect `(created_at, id)` ordering and bb8
  connection pooling.
- [ ] Update the repository layer to surface pagination-aware errors (e.g.
  invalid cursor format, unsupported direction) with HTTP 400 responses.
- [ ] Ensure pagination telemetry records page size, cursor direction, and
  page traversal counts for analytics.

### Step: Documentation and quality gates

- [ ] Update the OpenAPI schema, async API artefacts, and developer guides to
  document the new `cursor`/`limit` query parameters and response envelope.
- [ ] Add integration tests exercising forward and backward pagination, plus
  contract tests guaranteeing link generation and page-size guardrails.
- [ ] Provide sample client implementations (TypeScript and Rust) that follow
  `next`/`prev` links without constructing URLs manually.

## Phase 4 – Background jobs and caching

Background workers and caches must interact with the domain exclusively via
the queue, cache, and repository ports defined in Phase 0.

### Step: Worker deployment

- [ ] Deploy Apalis worker pools in Kubernetes with queue partitioning,
  bounded retries, and dead-letter handling for `GenerateRoute` and
  `Enrichment` jobs.

### Step: Caching strategy

- [ ] Finalize the Redis caching adapter, so requests share canonicalized
  keys, jittered TTLs, and metrics for hit/miss ratios before enabling caching
  in production.
- [ ] Implement cache invalidation hooks for schema or engine version
  upgrades, including namespace suffix rotation and eviction-safe rollouts.
- [ ] Add contract tests verifying canonicalization rules (sorted themes,
  rounded coordinates, SHA-256 key format).

## Phase 5 – Map delivery and observability

Tile serving and telemetry must remain adapter concerns; domain services
publish events and metrics through their ports only.

### Step: Tile service rollout

- [ ] Deploy Martin with POI and route sources, read-only credentials, and
  ingress routing via `/tiles` or `tiles.wildside.app`.
- [ ] Add the `get_route_tile` PostGIS function, JWT validation path, and
  Grafana dashboards covering tile latency and error rates.

### Step: Observability extensions

- [ ] Install Prometheus exporters for API, workers, Redis, Postgres, and
  Martin, wiring alerts for latency spikes, queue backlogs, and cache
  eviction rates.
- [ ] Extend structured logging to include route IDs, user IDs, and trace IDs
  across HTTP, WebSocket, and worker boundaries with Loki dashboards.
- [ ] Instrument PostHog events (`RouteGenerated`, `UserSignup`, etc.) with
  consistent payload schemas and batching policies.

## Phase 6 – GitOps and environments

Operational safeguards should track the ports and adapters in deployment
artefacts to keep environment drift visible.

### Step: FluxCD resilience

- [ ] Harden FluxCD pipelines so manifests in `deploy/` reconcile cleanly
  across environments with image digest pinning and pull-request previews.

### Step: Operational runbooks

- [ ] Publish runbooks describing rolling upgrades, session-key rotation, and
  Martin or worker scaling procedures, referencing the observability
  dashboards.
- [ ] Automate preview-environment teardown and resource reclamation
  policies, including TTL enforcement and secret revocation.
