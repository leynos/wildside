# pg_embedded_setup_unpriv user guide

The `pg_embedded_setup_unpriv` binary prepares a PostgreSQL installation and
data directory regardless of whether it starts with `root` privileges. When the
process runs as `root` it stages directories for `nobody` and delegates
PostgreSQL lifecycle commands to the worker helper, which executes as the
sandbox user. Unprivileged invocations keep the current identity and provision
directories with the caller’s UID. This guide explains how to configure the tool
and integrate it into automated test flows.

## Prerequisites

- Linux host, VM, or container. `root` access enables the privilege-dropping
  path, but unprivileged executions are also supported.
- Rust toolchain specified in `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- Outbound network access to crates.io and the PostgreSQL binary archive.
- System timezone database (package usually named `tzdata`).

## Quick start

1. Choose directories for the staged PostgreSQL distribution and the cluster’s
   data files. They must be writable by whichever user will run the helper; the
   tool reapplies ownership and permissions on every invocation.

2. Export configuration:

   ```bash
   export PG_VERSION_REQ="=16.4.0"
   export PG_RUNTIME_DIR="/var/tmp/pg-embedded-setup-it/install"
   export PG_DATA_DIR="/var/tmp/pg-embedded-setup-it/data"
   export PG_SUPERUSER="postgres"
   export PG_PASSWORD="postgres_pass"
   ```

   Optionally set `PG_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECS` to override the 15-second drop
   budget. The helper accepts values between `1` and `600` seconds and reports
   an error when the override falls outside that range or cannot be parsed.

3. Run the helper (`cargo run --release --bin pg_embedded_setup_unpriv`). The
   command downloads the specified PostgreSQL release, ensures the directories
   exist, applies PostgreSQL-compatible permissions (0755 for the installation
   cache, 0700 for the runtime and data directories), and initialises the
   cluster with the provided credentials. Invocations that begin as `root`
   prepare directories for `nobody` and execute lifecycle commands through the
worker helper so the privileged operations run entirely under the sandbox
user. Ownership fix-ups occur on every call, so running the tool twice remains
idempotent.

4. Pass the resulting paths and credentials to your tests. If you use
   `postgresql_embedded` directly after the setup step, it can reuse the staged
   binaries and data directory without needing `root`.

 `make test` honours a `PG_WORKER_PATH` variable that mirrors the
 `PG_EMBEDDED_WORKER` environment variable used by the helper. Override it to a
 user-writable path when running locally without elevated permissions:

   ```bash
   PG_WORKER_PATH=/tmp/pg_worker make test
   ```

 The default remains `/var/tmp/pg_worker` to preserve CI behaviour.

## Bootstrap for test suites

Invoke `pg_embedded_setup_unpriv::bootstrap_for_tests()` in integration suites
when both the prepared filesystem layout and the resulting settings are needed.
The helper performs the same orchestration as the CLI entry point but returns a
`TestBootstrapSettings` struct containing the final
`postgresql_embedded::Settings` and the environment variables required to
exercise the cluster.

```rust
use pg_embedded_setup_unpriv::{bootstrap_for_tests, TestBootstrapSettings};
use pg_embedded_setup_unpriv::error::BootstrapResult;

fn bootstrap() -> BootstrapResult<TestBootstrapSettings> {
    let prepared = bootstrap_for_tests()?;
    for (key, value) in prepared.environment.to_env() {
        match value {
            Some(value) => std::env::set_var(&key, value),
            None => std::env::remove_var(&key),
        }
    }
    Ok(prepared)
}
```

`bootstrap_for_tests()` ensures that `PGPASSFILE`, `HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`,
`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, and `TZ` are populated with deterministic defaults. When a
timezone database can be discovered (currently on Unix-like hosts) the helper
also sets `TZDIR`; otherwise it leaves any caller-provided value untouched so
platform-specific defaults remain available. If the system timezone database is
missing, the helper returns an error advising the caller to install `tzdata` or
set `TZDIR` explicitly, making the dependency visible during test startup rather
than when PostgreSQL launches.

## Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) test clusters

`pg_embedded_setup_unpriv::TestCluster` wraps `bootstrap_for_tests()` with a
Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) lifecycle. Constructing the guard
starts PostgreSQL using the discovered settings, applies the environment
produced by the bootstrap helper, and exposes the configuration to callers.
Dropping the guard stops the instance and restores the prior process
environment, so subsequent tests start from a clean slate.

```rust,no_run
use pg_embedded_setup_unpriv::{TestCluster, error::BootstrapResult};

fn exercise_cluster() -> BootstrapResult<()> {
    let cluster = TestCluster::new()?;
    let url = cluster.settings().url("app_db");
    // Issue queries using any preferred client here.
    drop(cluster); // PostgreSQL shuts down automatically.
    Ok(())
}
```

The guard keeps `PGPASSFILE`, `TZ`, `TZDIR`, and the XDG directories populated
for the duration of its lifetime, making synchronous tests usable without extra
setup. Unit and behavioural tests assert that `postmaster.pid` disappears after
drop, demonstrating that no orphaned processes remain.

### Using the `rstest` fixture

`pg_embedded_setup_unpriv::test_support::test_cluster` exposes an `rstest`
fixture that constructs the RAII guard on demand. Import the fixture so it is in
scope and declare a `test_cluster: TestCluster` parameter inside an `#[rstest]`
function; the macro injects the running cluster automatically.

```rust,no_run
use pg_embedded_setup_unpriv::{test_support::test_cluster, TestCluster};
use rstest::rstest;

#[rstest]
fn runs_migrations(test_cluster: TestCluster) {
    let metadata = test_cluster.connection().metadata();
    assert!(metadata.port() > 0);
}
```

The fixture integrates with `rstest-bdd` v0.1.0-alpha4 so behaviour tests can
remain declarative as well:

```rust,no_run
use pg_embedded_setup_unpriv::{test_support::test_cluster, TestCluster};
use rstest_bdd_macros::scenario;

#[scenario(path = "tests/features/test_cluster_fixture.feature", index = 0)]
fn coverage(test_cluster: TestCluster) {
    let _ = test_cluster.environment();
}
```

If PostgreSQL cannot start, the fixture panics with a
`SKIP-TEST-CLUSTER`-prefixed message that retains the original error. Unit tests
fail immediately, while behaviour tests can convert known transient conditions
into soft skips via the shared `skip_message` helper.

### Connection helpers and Diesel integration

`TestCluster::connection()` exposes `TestClusterConnection`, a lightweight view
over the running cluster's connection metadata. Use it to read the host, port,
superuser name, generated password, or the `.pgpass` path without cloning the
entire bootstrap struct. When you need to persist those values beyond the guard
you can call `metadata()` to obtain an owned `ConnectionMetadata`.

Enable the `diesel-support` feature to call `diesel_connection()` and obtain a
ready-to-use `diesel::PgConnection`. The default feature set keeps Diesel
optional for consumers, while `make test` already enables `--all-features` so
the helper is exercised by the smoke tests.

```rust,no_run
use diesel::prelude::*;
use pg_embedded_setup_unpriv::TestCluster;

# fn main() -> pg_embedded_setup_unpriv::BootstrapResult<()> {
let cluster = TestCluster::new()?;
let connection = cluster.connection();
let url = connection.database_url("postgres");
assert!(url.starts_with("postgresql://"));

#[cfg(feature = "diesel-support")]
{
    let mut diesel_conn = connection.diesel_connection("postgres")?;
    #[derive(QueryableByName)]
    struct ValueRow {
        #[diesel(sql_type = diesel::sql_types::Integer)]
        value: i32,
    }

    let rows: Vec<ValueRow> = diesel::sql_query("SELECT 1 AS value")
        .load(&mut diesel_conn)?;
    assert_eq!(rows[0].value, 1);
}
# Ok(())
# }
```

## Privilege detection and idempotence

- `pg_embedded_setup_unpriv` detects its effective user ID at runtime. Root
  processes follow the privileged branch and complete all filesystem work as
  `nobody`; non-root invocations leave permissions untouched and keep the
  caller’s UID on the runtime directories.
- Both flows create the runtime directory with mode `0700` and the data
  directory with mode `0700`. Existing directories are re-chowned or re-mode’d
  to enforce the expected invariants, allowing two consecutive runs to succeed
  without manual cleanup.
- The XDG cache home stays `0755` so team-mates can inspect extracted binaries
  and logs when debugging CI issues. The runtime directory is clamped to `0700`
  because it holds the PostgreSQL socket, `postmaster.pid`, and `.pgpass`, so
  leaking read or execute access would expose credentials or let other users
  interfere with the helper’s cluster lifecycle.
- Behavioural tests driven by `rstest-bdd` exercise both branches to guard
  against regressions in privilege detection or ownership management.

## Integrating with root-only test agents

When authoring end-to-end tests that exercise PostgreSQL while the harness is
still running as `root`, follow these steps:

- Invoke `pg_embedded_setup_unpriv` before handing control to less-privileged
  workers. This prepares file ownership, caches the binaries, and records the
  superuser password in a location accessible to `nobody`.
- Export the `PG_EMBEDDED_WORKER` environment variable with the absolute path to
  the `pg_worker` helper binary. The library invokes this helper when it needs
  to execute PostgreSQL lifecycle commands as `nobody`.
- Keep the test process running as `root`; the helper binary demotes itself
  before calling into `postgresql_embedded` so the main process never changes
  UID mid-test.
- Ensure the `PGPASSFILE` environment variable points to the file created in the
  runtime directory so subsequent Diesel or libpq connections can authenticate
  without interactive prompts. The
  `bootstrap_for_tests().environment.pgpass_file` helper returns the path if the
  bootstrap ran inside the test process.
- Provide `TZDIR=/usr/share/zoneinfo` (or the correct path for your
  distribution) if you are running the CLI. The library helper sets `TZ`
  automatically and, on Unix-like hosts, also seeds `TZDIR` when it discovers a
  valid timezone database.

## Known issues and mitigations

- **TimeZone errors**: The embedded cluster loads timezone data from the host
  `tzdata` package. Install it inside the execution environment if you see
  `invalid value for parameter "TimeZone": "UTC"`.
- **Download rate limits**: `postgresql_embedded` fetches binaries from the
  Theseus GitHub releases. Supply a `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable if you
  hit rate limits in CI.
- **CLI arguments in tests**: `PgEnvCfg::load()` ignores `std::env::args` during
  library use so Cargo test filters (for example,
  `bootstrap_privileges::bootstrap_as_root`) do not trip the underlying Clap
  parser. Provide configuration through environment variables or config files
  when embedding the crate.
- **Legacy `with_temp_euid` helper**: The helper now returns an error because
  the library no longer mutates the process UID mid-test. Configure
  `PG_EMBEDDED_WORKER` instead so the subprocess performs the privilege drop.
