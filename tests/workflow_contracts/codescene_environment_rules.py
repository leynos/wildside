"""Hold the CodeScene token's environment to the uploading job (CV-005).

The token lives in the `codescene` environment, whose deployment policy admits
`main` alone. So every job that invokes the uploader declares that
environment, no other job does, and no workflow a pull request can start
declares it in any job: a declaration there would let branch code ask for the
token.

The module is self-contained: it reads the workflows with a loader that
refuses duplicate keys, finds what a pull request can start from each
workflow's triggers, and follows local reusable-workflow calls from there.
