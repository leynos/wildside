"""Contract for the timers that can end a test run.

Four independent budgets can end a coverage lane, each set somewhere
different, and they only work if each sits above the one inside it. All
four are set here once this contract lands: a per-test ``slow-timeout``
and a whole-run ``global-timeout`` in ``.config/nextest.toml``, the
shared coverage action's wall-clock watchdog on the ``cargo``
invocation, and the job's own ``timeout-minutes``.

The outermost tier was the one missing. Neither coverage job declared
``timeout-minutes``, so both inherited GitHub's six-hour default while
the pull-request lane already runs for eighteen minutes.

The contract also holds the inner ordering, which this repository does
satisfy: a 600 s whole-run budget above a 360 s largest per-test
allowance, and a 1,800 s watchdog above that budget once nextest's
termination procedure and a cold build are counted.

See "Test timeouts: four tiers, outermost last" in
``docs/developers-guide.md``, and the canonical wording in
`leynos/shared-actions`' `generate-coverage` README.
