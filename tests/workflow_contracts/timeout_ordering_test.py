"""Contract for the timers that can end a test run.

Four independent budgets can end a coverage lane, each set somewhere
different, and they only work if each sits above the one inside it. All
four are set here once this contract lands: a per-test ``slow-timeout``
and a whole-run ``global-timeout`` in ``.config/nextest.toml``, the
shared coverage action's wall-clock watchdog on the ``cargo``
invocation, and the job's own ``timeout-minutes``.

The outermost tier was the one set wrong. Both coverage jobs were capped
at 90 minutes, exactly the watchdog's budget, so a step that spent that
budget was cancelled by the job timer rather than reported by the
watchdog.

The three inner tiers were already sound, and this contract holds them
there: a 3,600 s whole-run budget above a 300 s largest per-test
allowance, and a 5,400 s watchdog above that budget once nextest's
termination procedure and a cold build are counted.

The readings these assertions rest on are exercised in
``timeout_reading_test.py``; the helpers themselves live in
``timeout_budgets.py`` and ``coverage_lanes.py``.

See "Test timeouts: four tiers, outermost last" in
``docs/developers-guide.md``, and the canonical wording in
`leynos/shared-actions`' `generate-coverage` README.
