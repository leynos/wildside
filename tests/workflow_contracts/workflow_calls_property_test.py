"""Property tests for the pull-request closure over workflow calls.

`workflow_calls.reachable_workflows` is compared with an independent
reference: a fixed-point iteration that widens the reached set until it stops
growing, sharing nothing with the implementation's work list. Generated
graphs are bounded and finite, and mix multiple roots, branches, converging
edges, cycles, self-calls, duplicate calls and disconnected workflows, which
no fixed example shows at once.

Run via ``make test-workflow-contracts``.
