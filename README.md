# wildside

Wildside is a mobile “serendipity engine” for urban exploration, generating
bespoke, narrative-rich walking tours tailored to user interests, time, and
location. Leveraging OpenStreetMap, Wikidata, and a custom orienteering-based
algorithm, it optimises for “interestingness” over efficiency. The MVP will be
a PWA with a Rust/React stack, self-hosted map/routing services, and a strong
data-validation pipeline. The strategy emphasises cost control, security-first
AI integration, and clear differentiation from fitness, hiking, and static tour
apps.
